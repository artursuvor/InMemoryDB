# Project Description

## InMemoryDB

### Overview

This project implements an in-memory database (`InMemoryDB`) with several methods to manage key-value data and perform operations like setting values, retrieving them, deleting keys or specific columns, and retrieving top keys based on the number of columns set.

### Methods Implemented

#### 1. SET_OR_INC(key: string, column: string, value: any): void

- **Purpose**: This method sets or increments a column value for a given key.
- **Parameters**:
  - `key`: A string representing the key in the database.
  - `column`: A string representing the column name under the key.
  - `value`: The value to set or increment for the specified column.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the `key` exists in the database, it checks if the `column` already exists. If it does, it increments its value by `value`. If not, it sets the column to `value`.
  - If the `key` does not exist, it creates a new entry with the specified `column` and `value`.

#### 2. GET(key: string): any

- **Purpose**: Retrieves the entire set of columns and their values for a given key.
- **Parameters**:
  - `key`: A string representing the key to retrieve from the database.
- **Returns**: An object representing all columns and their values associated with the `key`.
- **Behavior**:
  - Retrieves all columns and their corresponding values stored under the specified `key` in the database.

#### 3. DELETE(key: string, column?: string): boolean

- **Purpose**: Deletes either the entire key or a specific column under the key.
- **Parameters**:
  - `key`: A string representing the key to delete from the database.
  - `column` (optional): A string representing the specific column to delete under the `key`.
- **Returns**: `true` if deletion was successful, `false` otherwise.
- **Behavior**:
  - If only `key` is provided, deletes the entire entry for that `key` from the database.
  - If both `key` and `column` are provided, deletes the specified `column` under the `key`.
  - Returns `true` if deletion is successful, `false` if the `key` or `column` does not exist in the database.

#### 4. TOP_N_KEYS(count: number): string[]

- **Purpose**: Returns the top `<count>` keys with the highest number of columns set in the database.
- **Parameters**:
  - `count`: An integer specifying how many top keys to retrieve.
- **Returns**: An array of strings representing the top `<count>` keys.
- **Sorting Criteria**:
  - **Counting Columns**: Calculates the number of columns set for each key.
  - **Selecting Top Keys**: Selects the top `<count>` keys with the highest number of columns.
  - **Lexicographical Order**: If multiple keys have the same number of columns, they are ordered lexicographically (alphabetically).
- **Behavior**:
  - Iterates through all keys in the database, counts the number of columns for each key.
  - Sorts keys first by the number of columns in descending order.
  - If keys have the same number of columns, sorts them lexicographically.
  - Returns an array of strings in the format `<key>(<column_count>)` representing the top `<count>` keys.

### Running Tests with Jest

To run tests for this project using Jest, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jest**: If Jest is not already installed, you can install it globally or locally as a dev dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn add --dev jest
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: Once Jest is installed, you can run your tests using:
   ```bash
   npx jest
   ```
   This command will execute all test files matching the default pattern `*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`, located in the current directory and its subdirectories.

### Testing

Ensure that the methods (`SET_OR_INC`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `TOP_N_KEYS`) are tested thoroughly to cover different scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the `InMemoryDB` functionality.
